              <h5 >Every great adventure has a beginning and ours began, “four score and seven years ago,” — just kidding — 
                actually long before that in 2006! Initially, we were unsure of exactly the type of restaurant we wanted to open, 
                we knew it had to be a place that would warm your spirit with great local food, drink and lots of good jokes. We promise! <br /> <br/>
                In May 2006, our dream started to become a reality when we raised funds, received support from our closest friends and family, 
                purchased a small bar and packed up our tools and headed to Middletown, Delaware. Four months later, after a mass renovation, we 
                opened the doors of Tom Foolery’s.
